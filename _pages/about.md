I am a Computer Science PhD Candidate at <a href='https://www.uniroma1.it/en'>Sapienza University of Rome</a>, where I am part of the <a href='https://www.pinlab.org/'>Perception and Intelligence Laboratory (PINlab)</a>, supervised by <a href='https://fgalasso.bitbucket.io'>Professor Fabio Galasso</a>. 

My research focuses on <b>Socially Aware Robotics</b> and <b>Human-Robot Interaction</b>, with a background in <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning</b>.

Previously, I led a small development team for a startup company and worked as a web development consultant. I have since focused my career on research and am open to opportunities for <i>research internships</i>, <i>collaborative visits</i>, and industry or academic projects in my areas of interest.
